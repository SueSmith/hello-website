# Your New Website ðŸ¤©

Oh hi! Welcome to your new website. ðŸ›¼

You can make edits in the files by opening them from the left sidebar. Your website preview will update as you edit!

Share your draft site with collaborators by opening **PORTS**, changing `private` to `public` and copying the URL.

## Deploy your site to Fastly Compute

Ready to share your site with the world? Deploy it to Fastly to make it available for everyone everywhere all at once!

Grab a Fastly API key from your account and add it to your GitHub repo:

* Sign up for a <strong><a href="https://www.fastly.com/signup/" target="_blank">free Fastly developer account</a></strong>
* Grab an **API Token** from **Account** > **Personal Profile** > **API Tokens** > **Create Token**
  * _Type_: Automation
  * _Role_: Engineer
  * _Scope_: Global (deselect the _Read-only access_ box)
  * _Access_: All services
  * _Expiration_: Never expire
* **Copy the token value into your GitHub repo**
  * Open **Settings** > **Secrets and Variables** > **Codespaces**
  * Create a **New repository secret**
  * Enter the name `FASTLY_API_TOKEN`
  * Paste your token value in and save

Back in your codespace, you should see a prompt to reload for the new environment variable so go ahead and click that.

Hit the **ðŸš€ Deploy** button and watch the Terminal output for your new site address!

Open it in a new tab and tell everyone you know. ðŸŽ¢
